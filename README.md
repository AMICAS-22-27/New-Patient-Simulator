This repository contains the AMICAS Simulator, a flexible simulation environment 
for exploring patient databases, surface response models, disturbance profiles, and more. 
The simulator allows users to adjust key parameters and settings, 
making it adaptable to a range of simulation needs.

Getting Started:

To access all simulator files, please download Simulator_AMICAS.rar from this repository. 
Once downloaded, extract the files to your desired directory.

The main program file, MAIN_PROGRAM_AMICAS.m, is the central control point for the simulator. 
Here, users can configure and customize various aspects of the simulation.

Features:

The simulator offers flexibility in key areas, including:

Patient databases – Easily select different databases based on your requirements.
Surface response models – Choose from various models to match your simulation needs.
Disturbance profiles – Adjust disturbance profiles to simulate different scenarios.
Anesthesiologist interaction – Option to include an anesthesiologist in the simulation loop.
Patient selection – Choose specific patients or patient groups for tailored simulation experiences.

How to Use the Simulator:

Below are the key steps for setting up and running the simulator:

Step 1: Choose Your Database
In the MAIN_PROGRAM_AMICAS.m file, specify the patient database you want to use. 
This allows you to tailor the simulation to different patient groups and datasets.

Step 2: Specify the Simulation Time
Define the duration of the simulation by setting the appropriate variable. 
This enables you to run simulations over customized time intervals.

Step 3: Choose Your Inputs
Select the desired input parameters for the simulation. 
This step provides control over the specific variables and conditions applied in the simulation.

Step 4: Choose Your Response Surface Model
Specify the response surface model to use, 
allowing you to define how the system reacts under different conditions.

Step 5: Choose Your Disturbance Profile
Select a disturbance profile to simulate various scenarios 
and test system resilience under different disturbances.

Step 6: Choose Anesthesiologist in the Loop
Optionally, include an anesthesiologist model 
in the simulation loop for a more dynamic simulation environment.

Step 7: Choose Patient(s)
Select individual patients or groups from the database 
to customize the simulation and analyze responses for specific cases.

Requirements:

MATLAB R2022a (version 9.12) or an alternative program capable of running .m files.
